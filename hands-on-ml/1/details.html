    Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow</a>, written by Aurélien Géron.

<h5>How was this chart made?</h5>
<p>
  Starting from the <a class='accent' href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1491962291">
  "Hands-On ML"</a>, I collected from Amazon 10 books that are most often bought together. Then, for each found book, I collected
  5 more books that are most often bought together with them. Finally, I did this one more time for each found book.
</p>
<p>
  After that, I ran my own algorithm to make a city from these books:
</p>

<p>
  The algorithm tends to group similar books into districts. You can find advanced theoretical books like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0262035618"
    class='accent'>Deep Learning</a>
  and <a class='accent' href="https://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-Principles-Computation/dp/0262013193?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0262013193">Probabilistic
    Graphical Models</a>
  clustered together in the North West. "For Dummies" series clustered on the East. North regions are taken by financial machine
  learning, and South is occupied by Python/Data Science books.
</p>
<p>The roads on the map have symbolic meaning. The thicker the road, the more books are connected through it.</p>
<h5>So What?</h5>
<p>
  First of all, I loved the <a class='accent' href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1491962291">Hands-On
    ML</a> book. For me, it was the most comprehensive introduction into Machine Learning.
</p>
<p>
  Secondly, I find it fascinating to see the neighborhood as a reflection of my own feelings for the book:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The book starts with introduction into Data Science.
    </li>
    <li>
      It feels very welcoming to beginners from the first pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Yet it does not shy away from explaining complex theory and principles of Machine Learning
    </li>
    <li>
      The main programming language of the book is Python. Seeing R in this graph is not very surprising, as a lot of data science
      happens in this language. I assume more generic data science/deep learning books have pulled R into the neighborhood.
    </li>
    <li>
      The book goes pretty deep into deep learning with TensorFlow.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is no straight road from the book to the cluster of financial machine learning. The book doesn't touch any specific
      algorithm of financial ML, yet it doesn't take too much effort to imagine how the ideas of deep learning, statistics,
      reinforcement learning could lead to the world of Finance.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>I just cannot recommend the
  <a class='accent' href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1491962291">
  "Hands-On ML"</a>
  highly enough. Read it if you'd like to enter into the world of Machine Learning smoothly.
